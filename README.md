### [Note] This is the first time I am sharing my dotfiles. This one may be not the best config, but I personally love it.</br>

## [ Must Read ]
As I use only a Desktop Pc, I don't have any laptop. That's why I could not test some features like Bletooth and Brightness Controller. Also this script is not supported for Nvidia GPU Drivers and Asus ROG laptops.

## Clone the repository and every necessary packages will be installed in your system.

### Packages I have used for this configuration:
- (all of the above components) plus
- `swwww` - for wallpaper and wallpaper animation
- `swaylock` - for lockscreen
- `swaylock-effects` - for swaylock effects
- `dunst` - for notifications
- `swappy` - for screenshot
- `brightnessctl`  - for monitor and keyboard brightness - not needed for desktop
- `swayimg` - for image viewer 
- `pamixer` - for volume control notification.
- `fonts` - required awesome fonts. AUR and official repo have
- `pipewire` - needed pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa
- `nwg-look` - for gtk themes
- `kvantum` - for qt5 themes
 </br>

### Themes (Optional):
- I have used Nordic theme as the dark theme and Snow-v40 as the light theme `(For GTk Themes)` You can change themes using `nwg-look`.

### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/me-js-bro/OpenSuse-Hyprland.git
```
 ### Now run these commands

```
cd OpenSuse-Hyprland
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
